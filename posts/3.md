Add the `socks-proxy` directive to your openvpn configuration file, and you are done.
```
socks-proxy 127.0.0.1 1080
```
Additionally, you need to connect to the upstream directly(through your local gateway). Use the `route` directive, supposing your upstream ip is `123.123.123.123`.
```
route 123.123.123.123 255.255.255.255 net_gateway
```
