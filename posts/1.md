## The Weechat Relay
As is said in the [weechat doc](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#relay_plugin'), the weechat relay can relay weechat data. All relay protocols support WebSocket, so now we can use [nginx](https://www.nginx.com) as a web socket reverse proxy with weechat.
## Setup a Weechat Relay
### Open Weechat
Start a weechat relay with the `weechat` protocol, and make it listen to port 9000, and now it can be connected using websocket.

`/relay add weechat 9000`

As you can see, `weechat` is the relay's `name` and `protocol`, and you can delete the relay by executing `/relay del weechat`.

### Setup NGINX
I usually have `weechat` running in a `tmux` buffer (or session?). Now we need to set-up the reverse proxy in order to expose the `weechat relay` safely to the internet. Here is how I did it.

Now assume we have a `debian` server and `weechat.example.com` is resolved to the server's public IP address(has an `A` or `AAAA` record!).

Install nginx, certbot and the nginx plugin for certbot.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx certbot python-certbot-nginx
```

Now create a configuration file for nginx (assuming you are logged in as `root`):

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
touch weechat.example.com.conf
ln -svf $PWD/weechat.example.com.conf ../sites-enabled
```
Now edit `weechat.example.com.conf`. Here is an example (without SSL!):

```nginx
server {
	server_name weechat.example.com;
	listen 80;
	location / {
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
	}
}
```

Now run `nginx -t` to make sure there aren't any syntax errors and `nginx -s reload` to tell nginx to reload.

Run `certbot` to generate the certificates for SSL and help us finish the setup (it'll edit your `weechat.example.com.conf` and reload nginx for you!).

## Connect to the Relay Using `weechat-android`
Here is an example:

## Trouble Shooting
### 403 Forbidden
If you don't know what the variable `relay.network.websocket_allowed_origins` means, set it to `"*"` or `""` so that you can access the WebSocket interface.
