## SASL(Simple Authentication and Security Layer)
Normally, you will need your nickname and password in order to login to an irc server. This time, however, I'll teach you how to login with a client certificate.

## Generating Your Certificate
Here,
```
openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 109600 -nodes -out irc.pem -keyout irc.pem
```
This command will put the private key and your certificate to `irc.pem`.

Use the following command to check when your certificate expires (It will expire in 109600 days or rather 300 years):
```
openssl x509 -in irc.pem -noout -enddate
```

Put your certificate in `~/.weechat` like below (or ${WEECHAT_HOME}, if you've set that variable):
```
mkdir -p ~/.weechat/certs
mv irc.pem ~/.weechat/certs
```

## Register at OFTC
Open weechat and add the OFTC server:

```
/server add oftc irc.oftc.net/6697 -ssl
```
Then we do some basic settings:

```
/set irc.server.oftc.nicks "mynick,mynick2,mynick3,mynick4,mynick5"
/set irc.server.oftc.username "My user name"
/set irc.server.oftc.realname "My real name"
/set irc.server.oftc.autoconnect on
/set irc.server.oftc.ssl on
/set irc.server.oftc.ssl_cert %h/certs/irc.pem
/set irc.server.oftc.sasl_mechanism external
```
Then we connect to the server:
```
/connect oftc
```
Then tell NickServ to register your nickname:
```
/msg NickServ REGISTER YourPassword youremail@example.com
```
Then go to [services.oftc.net](https://services.oftc.net) to login with your nickname and password and [verify your account](https://services.oftc.net/account/verify).

Don't forget to tell `NickServ` to check your verification status:
```
/msg NickServ checkverify
```
## Add the Certificate to Your Account
```
/msg NickServ CERT ADD
```

Disconnect and connect again, now you are using your certificate for authentication (as an external mechanism for SASL)!
