## The EMACS Server
EMACS can be started as a daemon(a program that runs in the background) by executing `emacs --daemon` which then can be connected by `emacsclient`(use `emacsclient -c` to create a frame). You'll save a lot of time by using `emacsclient` since the `emacs.d` directory would be loaded by the daemon(server) and the `emacsclient` is only the front-end.

Note that the emacs server can be started automatically by `emacsclient -c` as well, if you set the `ALTERNATE_EDITOR` environment variable to empty(run `export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=""` in a unix shell, otherwise if there is no server, `emacsclient` will attempt to start other editors like vim). We can make use of this to setup our EDITOR to `emacsclient` by adding these two exports to `.bashrc`(Assuming you use bash as your shell):
```
export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=""
export EDITOR="emacsclient -c"
```
## Wrapping emacsclient
It is obvious that `emacsclient -c` is a valid bash command but not an executable file, so if you run `$EDITOR` in your shell, it will complain. We can wrap this command to [a simple script](/runec.txt).

I have the script at `~/.local/bin/runec`(`~/.local/bin` is in my `PATH` variable). Do remember to give the script the permission to execute(`chmod +x ~/.local/bin/runec`), then you can setup your `EDITOR` variable like this:
```
export EDITOR="runec"
```
