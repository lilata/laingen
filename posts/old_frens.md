I had many friends as a kid. Back then we didn't use phones or computers as much so we could talk about whatever we wanted without worrying about being censored or shut down, and honestly, we didn't have much to say about politics or the government that's worthy of being taken down. I was a good kid and pretty much conformed to the schools' left-wing or collectivist propaganda.

Things changed when I read about Ayn Rand. I discovered this powerful but not so sophisticated woman on Amazon and found her book, *The Fountainhead*, in which, as far as I can vaguely remember, she wrote about this capitalist engineer and his story about fighting against the corrupted and bloted communist government. It was the first time that I got to know about American Indivisualism. I was so passionate about Rand's ideas but when I talked to my friends, they all told me that they'd rather do nothing and continue with the status quo. It's funny to me now that I blocked many of my friends on IM apps who I thought were socialists or communists.

Now I'm not really a libertarian after I studied a lot about ancient writings such as Hávamál, but I still value libertarianism in some way, because libertarian values can really push someone to repel against the brain-washing from those propaganda organizations. And none of my friends has ever read Ayn Rand, and on my IM app I add people back and block them again and again. But now I've realized that I don't really belong to those apps that "normal" people use. I fucking hate being censored and I fucking hate organized propaganda.

I don't have these old friends anymore. There are people I know from work but usually I don't particularly like them. So if you are based (you don't have to be red-pilled), talk to me on xmpp or send me an email!
