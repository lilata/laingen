## PAM
Linux uses PAM for user authentication, so look at `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`, and you'll see the default unix password authentication library `pam_unix.so`.

To chain authentication libraries, set the last library to `sufficient` and all others before that library to `required`.

Before we change the configuration, be sure to keep an active session, b/c you won't be able to login if you make some mistake.

## Google Authenticator PAM Library
On debian, install it with
```
sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator -y
```

And add this:

```
auth sufficient pam_google_authenticator.so
```

to `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` after `pam_unix.so`, and change the necessity of `pam_unix.so` to `required`.

The config will look like this:
```
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth required pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth sufficient pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Finally, run `google-authenticator` to generate a TOTP token url, and you can use any authenticator app or program to import the token and generate passwords. (I recommend [pass-otp](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp)).

Try to login again(you can do a login with `ssh username@localhost`), it should ask for an OTP after you enter your user password.
