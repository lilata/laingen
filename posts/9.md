## First things to do
First, you need to clone my repository from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/lilata/blog-gen.git
```
Then you may want to delete my posts:
```
rm posts/*
```
And you should change the blog name in `gen.sh` and `templates/index.html`

So, today is May 31st, 2021. Create a file in the `posts` directory and name it `2021-05-31.html`. Then you can write some stuff in it. Just remember the first line of `2021-05-31.html` will be treated as part of the post's title, and the whole title will be `2021-05-31|the_first_line`.

## The Post File
You can use any html tag here as you wish, but do remember to escape some special characters so `sed` and `perl` won't complain.

Additionally, use the `b` tag when you are putting some code in your post.

## Generate the Pages
Use `./gen.sh` to generate the index page and all your post pages, and those pages will be in the `output` directory, where you can use any http server like nginx to serve them.

## A Tip about Serving
There is a built-in http server in python. You can run `python3 -m http.server` to serve the current directory at port 8000.
